# tutorials
This repository is just filled with a collection of source
files that I wrote while creating a mini video series on
Youtube for my Nephew and anyone else who might be interested
in learning C and or C++.
If you are curious, you can check the series out at:

All code in this repository is MIT licensed so it can be used
without trouble for you or myself (waving of legal liability)
but allowance for all types of usage so long as accredidation
is provided with projects using it). With that said, I doubt
that much of the code will be useful for anyone outside of
perhaps occasional reference for syntax or common approaches.
